## What are my responsibilities as a Tour de Sol participant?

Please see section “2c Tour de Sol Details” of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view)  for details.

### How is the “50% of the active Tour event time” responsibility calculated?

\[TBD\]

To be eligible for rewards in a given stage, a validator must submit votes in &gt;= 50% of that stage’s slots. 

If a validator isn’t able to submit &gt;= 50% of votes for a stage and still feels they should receive awards for that stage, they can petition Solana for reconsideration.

## Is there a relationship between the Tour de Sol testnet tokens and Solana mainnet tokens?

No. Please see section ”2d Tour de Sol Details” of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view) for details.

## Can a validator be disqualified from the Tour de Sol?

Yes. A validator be disqualified from the Tour de Sol if they engage in prohibited conduct and/or fails to provide the minimum level of services described in question \#4 above.

Please also see Section “4 Prohibited Conduct” of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view) for a more detailed description of prohibited conduct.

### More questions related to Prohibited Conduct:

#### As referenced in section “4 Prohibited Conduct”, what would be an example of providing Tour Services from a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction of my residence? Does this mean my server has to reside in the jurisdiction of my residence?

No. Servers can be in other jurisdictions that differ from a participant’s residency. By signing the  [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view) the participant has represented that they are delivering their services from the US if they reside there or from outside the US if they are not residing within the US.

\[TBD - “Use our Solana Services other than their intended purpose…” and “Reverse engineer…” may conflict with the concept of an adversarial testnet.\]

\[TBD - “Develop or use any applications…” may discourage third party tool development.\]

\[TBD - The 4\(b\) arbitrariness could cause issues if unfairly applied.\]

## How are rewards calculated?

Reward will be calculated according to the compensation design described in [this forum post](https://forums.solana.com/t/tour-de-sol-stage-1-preliminary-compensation-design/79) and [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11puBSw2THdO4wU-uyDEic-D03jg4ZAooVpcZU0w_4gI/edit#gid=218406032).

## What are the requirements to receive rewards?

Participants must have signed the Tour de SOL participation agreement, passed KYC/AML as an individual via CoinList’s platform, as well as the tax form W-8 or W-9 \(depending on your residency\) prior to participating in the Tour. A participant may participate in any and all stages that begin after they complete registration. The final registrations dates will be announced publicly on a stage-by-stage basis.

Lastly, participants must sign Solana’s standard [Token Agreement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O4cEUZzeSNoVcncbHcEegAqPgjT-7hcy). The Token Agreement will be made available by Solana prior to the rewards issuance date.

## What are the tax implications of the rewards?

Participants are entering into a service agreement with Solana with discretionary compensation associated with the services. They are not considered to be a full-time employee of the company and therefore Solana is collecting w9 and w8 forms in order to support tax reporting obligations, if applicable. Solana recommends participants consult with a tax accountant to understand any potential tax implications.

Also, as stated in Sections 2i, 2k and 10c of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view):

> 2k - To receive any SOL Reward, a Finalist must sign the Company’s standard form of SOL Reward Agreement which will include the terms and conditions governing the ownership and use of the SOL that are issued as the SOL Reward, including but not limited to applicable lockups required by securities laws, blackout dates and tax reporting information.

> 10c - You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your transactions on any Protocol, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission \(“CFTC”\), the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \(“SEC”\), and the tax laws applicable to any remuneration received by you from Company.

## Section 8 of the [TOUR DE SOL PARTICIPATION TERMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ueLG6VJoQ5Hx4rnpjFeuL3pG5DbrBbE/view) references confidentiality. How will we know what we can and cannot share publicly?

Solana doesn’t intend to share any confidential information during the Tour de Sol. However if we do it will be called out as such within our communications verbally, by email, etc. Unless information is specifically called out as such, the information should not be considered confidential and we welcome you to share it.
