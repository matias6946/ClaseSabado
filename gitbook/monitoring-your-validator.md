# Monitoring Your Validator

* Run `solana get-slot` to track the progress of your validator as it catches up with the cluster after you first connect.
* Use the `solana balance` command to monitor the earnings as your validator is selected as leader and collects transaction fees
* `solana uptime ~/validator-vote-keypair.json` will display the voting history (aka, uptime) of your validator over recent Epochs

* Run [rpc-check.sh](https://github.com/solana-labs/tour-de-sol/blob/master/rpc-check.sh) periodically
